# Instructions
The repo contains 2 projects, 1 a class library of the Algo Assessment & a unit tests project which contains
tests for the implementation. 

*__NOTE__*: Not all the unit tests are correct.

* Create a fork of this repository in your own GitHub account
* Choose 3 algorithm & 1 data structure challenge to complete
* Implement your solution to the challenges & run the unit tests to see if the solution works
* Please consider your git history as this will be reviewed
* Commit & push code regularly
* Once complete, please send a link to your repository to tim@geminisolution.co.za and CC: elrika@geminisolution.co.za.

## Algorithms
This repository consists of 6 challenges, 4 algorithmic & 2 data structures

### 1. Anagram
Check if 2 words are anagrams of one another.

### 2. Equivalence index
Find the index where the sum of all the items to the left of the index, are equal to the sum of all the items to the right of the index.

### 3. Format numbers
Convert an integer into a string representation formatted with comma's every 3 digits, without using any of the string formatting functions.

### 4. Vowel count
Count all the vowels in the given word or sentence.

## Data structures

### 1. Queue
Implement a basic queue data structure, please do not use linq & stick with the most basic collecion structure possible, such as an array.

### 2. Stack
Implement a basic stack data structure, please do not use linq & stick with the most basic collecion structure possible, such as an array.
